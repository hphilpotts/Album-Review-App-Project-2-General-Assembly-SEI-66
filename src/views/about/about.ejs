<h1 class="large-heading text-center">About 'Album Review App':</h1>
<br>
<section class="text-center">
    <h5><span class="italic">Album Review App</span> is a site where - as the name might suggest - users
        can add and then review music albums.
    </h5>
    <br>
    <p> This site was built as part of a paired project with <a href="https://github.com/milosjocic1">Milos Jocic (on GitHub: milosjocic1)</a>
            over the course of a week, for our second project as part of GA London's Software Engineering Immersive course. 
            It is a full-stack web app, using an <span class="italic">Express.js</span> framework, <span class="italic">Node.js</span> platform and an 
            Atlas-hosted <span class="italic">MongoDB</span> NoSQL database. 
            The deployed project was presented to the GA Instructional Team and our fellow SEI cohort on 26/08/22.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> Initially hosted via <span class="italic">Heroku</span>, I then redeployed the app via <span class="italic">Vercel</span>
            in November 2022. This later deployment stopped running at some stage in spring 2023.
    </p>
    <p> This version of the site is a re-written and rehosted version of the original project. Built on top of the exisiting source code, 
            the 'spirit' of the original site is retained, however the code has been refactored and re-written with, with bugs removed and
            previously planned missing features implemented.
