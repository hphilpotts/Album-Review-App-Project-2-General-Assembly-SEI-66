# 'Album Review App' : SEI Project 2             

## Description:       

<!-- TODO : link to Milos' GitHub profile -->

This is a full-stack web app - _Album Review App_: a site where users can add and then review music albums - built as part of a paired project with Milos Jocic over the course of a week, for the second project in GA London's Software Engineering Immersive course. The app uses an Express framework, Node.js platform and an Atlas-hosted MongoDB NoSQL database. The deployed project was presented to my GA Instructional Team and fellow SEI cohort on 26/08/22.        

I was 'Team Leader' for this project, taking responsibility for Git version control and deployment of the completed app. I also worked on functionality across the site, as well as UI styling and mobile responsive formatting.

## Getting started & Install:       

Please feel free to sign in as user: _guest@guest.com_ // pw: _London2012_ or create your own account with 'Sign Up'.      

Please note that at present, there is an issue with image upload where Heroku's ephemeral file storage deletes any newly uploaded images after less than 24 hours. As such, many of the image links are currently broken where uploaded files have been removed.     

To contribute, please fork and then run `npm i` to install the required dependencies, alternatively see `package.json`, submitting a pull request for any completed contributions.      

## Technologies used:       

- HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript, EJS, Mongoose        
- Express, Node.js, Atlas-hosted MongoDB        
- Express-EJS-Layouts, Multer image upload, Heroku app hosting       
- Visual Studio Code, MongoDB Compass       

## Brief & Project aims:        

The brief for this project was to build a web app as a pair 'from scratch', using an Express framework.Technical requirements included:        
- Use Express, Mongoose, Node.js and MongoDB to build the app, host the completed app on Heroku.              
- Employ MVC architecture in building the app.      
- Include a User resource, with signup/in and authentication/authorisation.            
- Include two other resources with full CRUD functionality.          

Stretch goals included:     
- Make the app mobile responsive.       
- Make use of a CSS library such as Bootstrap.      
- Add image upload functionality.       

The aim of the project was to consolidate our learning from weeks 4 & 5 of the course: in particular the concepts of 'Frontend' and 'Backend', OOJS, and database relationship and associations, as well as the use of Express, EJS, Mongoose, and MongoDB. In addition to consolidating knowledge, this project provided a first experience of working with another developer, with all the additional considerations and neccessities, for example management of Git/GitHub process, communication and planning, and collaborative problem-solving.
